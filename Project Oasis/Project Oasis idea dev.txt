Mode idea for starsector : Project Oasis
changing the negative planetary condition type to make them more intersting
and then create new condition meant to counter their less than desirable effect 
those new condition will hopefully reasult in the improvement of three thing : 

1. make planet trully feel different 
2. give a face to the people living in your market
3. make the new colonized planet truly feel unique

there should be multiple way of handeling a negative condition 
this way two planet with the same condition can still be different from one another
some new condition should counter multiple one

the default multiple choice should be along the line of 
1. (100k to 200k) credit, easy to deploy but barely worth it 
2. (300k to 500k) credit, harder remove all of the probleme but create new one that can be reduced with another decision
3. (1M to 10M) credit, this would require basically the same level of ressource has reactivating a megastructure in AOTD volt of knowledge but will come with increadible benefit and revome all negative effect without new one

all choice can be upgraded along the way into truly increadible form, the cheaper the price at the start the more pricey the upgrade are

the price of those improvement should be precier the worse the negative condition is 

the negative effect should be made worse not just by increasing the planetary hazard but also by adding new probleme
all negative condition should have at least one bonus that will stay after the counter is built 
the bonus should be good but not extremely good, meaning that other factor will play the major role in deciding if the planet is worth colonizing or not 
instead of it being always worth it

all of the improvement must be understandable, has oposed to like it's new tech black hole make the planet more spiny or other such thing

every improvement will be a planetary condition, not a building, not terraforming, not an item

while they might improve ressources it will be done so inderectly (exemple +1 to ore and rare ore production and such, and not make the ore condition go from normal to abundant) 

every planetary condition must have at least 2 counter that are only available for this specific one

no counter will be able to counter every condition, this would go against the very idea of making planet different 

if a new counter could lead to a new negative effect or worse a disaster this should be told explicity when the player look at the option (this is to make sure the player understand what they're doing and doens't feel like a punishment) 
upgrade for those should also be available at the start but for a price increase so that again there is a explicit way of avoiding the probleme, those upgrade should also be available at all time so that the player doesn't feel
like they are trapt with a disaster coming 
the worst disaster should be reducing the planet popuplation by 1 
nothing should destroy the colony and there should be ample warning before any big disaster happen 

those disaster will be seen at all time in the colonies crisis tab 
(they will have there own special tab with mini event along the way and a way to slow the progress and to stop it ( maybethe player should be able to turn of that part) ) 

1rst step of the mod : create the new negative impact of the condition ( this will be the base where the upgrade will build upon )

2nd step of the mod : create the basic counter condition 

3rd step of the mod : create the upgrade for the counter condition

	[Thin Atmosphere]
		Negative Effect :
	- increase the demand for heavy machinery and Metal
	- small negative inpact on planetary growth
	- planet cannot grow past size 5
	- reduce the planetary defence point
		Positive Effect : 
	- slightly increase accesiblity
	- increase mining production
