								|| PROJECT OASIS CHANGELOG ||



we will be reaching version 0.10 when all of the planetary condition are updated and working

0.5 when the planetary counter are added 

1.00 when the colonies crisis that make them being able to be added to planet are fully functional

EDIT : Version 0.001 > 

	Added needed file for getting the mod to work,
	this was based on the coding of Unkown skies(hopefully this is okay) Made by both Tartiflette (made the code) and Serenitis(created the assets),
	started work on the new thin condition upgrade, 
	most file are still completly empty,
	this is absolutly not working and I don't know,
	what I'm doing.
	DISCLAIMER : the file organisation and quite a few function has be taken from the work of another mod 
	the mod being UnkownSky, I have yet to have asked permission to do so and is willing to remove those same 
	file that have been taken from the mod if aksed 
	I will give apropriate information about this in the file that I have copied form the mod 
	I will either get permission or create my own function before the mod will be uploaded 
	considering my current advance this will take quite a while
