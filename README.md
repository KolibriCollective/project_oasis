# Project Oasis

Have you ever played starsector with mod like nexerlin or Aotd and taken or colonised worlds in the tens of digit and then realised \
that apart from your first world and maybe two more you simply couldn't name the rest ? that you felt like there was absolutly no\
difference between the local terran world with mild climate and the barren planet with no atmosphere ? after all they both reach size 6 \
and now won't grow anymore so the hazard condition really doesn't change much, sure both planet will have access to different item \
but does it really make those to planet completly different ?

what if condition like no atmosphere or extreme weather changed much more than the hazard condition \
making the colonisation of planet with those effect harder or easier, making you able to build around \
there specific advantage and maybe even invest into massive project that will make planets truly unique ? 

this is what Project Oasis is trying to achieve.


## that sound fun ! when is the mod going to be released ? 

I ... do not know, this is the first time making a mod in starsector \
so don't expect it to be released for quite a long time.

## unique? specific advantage ? planetary condition change other stuff that hazard condition ? that doesn't really give much to explain the idea would you perhaps have a concrete exemple ? 

has a matter of fact I do ! 

the first idea I had for this world centered around feeling frustrated that planet without atmosphere didn't get any accesibility bonus \
my resoning being that, if there was no molicule slowing down orbit much closer to the surface wouldn't that make lauching ressources or \
people much easier ? couldn't the waystation also be built much closer to the ground ? I mean low gravity does give a accesibility bonus \
so that seem easy to code. then I also thought if peoples live in places that have condition so close to simply living on a spaceship \
wouldn't that mean they would have an easier time making the jump from one to the other, well let's also make those planet have a bonus \
to the production of crew. 

that's a lot of positive here for smth that was supposed to be a condition make colonies harder to devlopp, what could the downside be. \
if those colonies oparate so closly to how a ship does then there should be a much bigger demand for supplies, maybe even higher demand for drug\
after all life around those world is bound to be anxiety inducing, one small hole and poof ! you become a pile of goo traveling at incredible speed,\
(that also would be a probleme if someone decided to try a create those hole so maybe decrease the planetary defence number), then there is also the matter\
of acutally keeping all of those space pressurized, massive pump cirulating the air, cleaning, and constently producing oxygen, that's heavy machinery \
well make those another cost of building a colony here, and all of that pressure gotta be kept inside, so much force applied constently on the foundation of \
any building, that probably require a ton of metals to build and for maintenance, add more metal demand then. 

## so what could be this big projects making this world a new paradises capable or rivaling the fabbled old world of the domain ? 

well there are three idea (this idea are very much subject to change so don't be sad if the specific idea never got added, well that and also this is going to in so long that you might have forgotten thenby the time I finally release the mod hahaha "evil noise and such")

1. this world need a lot of pressurized chamber, you know what else is pressurized and able to spend centuries in space ? spaceships, we will build all of the infrastructure from\
abandoned, partly destroyed or otherwize unusable spaceship, might even make some pirates think twice before raiding our colonies when their sensor detect a sea of new contact neatly\
parked, this living condition would definitly atract people with experience and is sure to make the other one get those quickly making this world on of the biggest training field for\
new crewman. 

2. remember the part about orbit being viable at much lower altitude ? what if we built everyting in orbit then, construting massise islands of steel orbiting at tens of meter from the\
surface,making not only the supply of ressources much eaiser but creating the perfect condition for production new spaceship at an industrial scale only seen in a few worlds in the \
persean sector.

3. maybe the easiest solution is simply to put everyting underground tens of meters under the surface, safe form the harsh condition on the surface we could build a new different type \
of paradise, one made of warm light set on a cycle imitating a day night cycle, with massive main chamber suporting green park where the colonists can experience even for a bit what \
life on earth could have been like.


# DISCLAIMER

Has I mentioned I don't really have any experience in modding Starsector, I do realise that for a first project this is increadibly complex, but this is kind of the fun of it.
I want it to take a long time to make, I spent the last 3 day creating the ground for this mod and those have been a lot of fun, a little bit like looking at the iner mechanism 
of a complex machine and slowly understanding it function, or perhaps more like slowy become the one handling the off stage work needed for a theater performance to run smoothly. 

One last thing that is has important some of the code that are in the mod where taken from another mod Unkown Skies, has this mod does create new planetary condition and for the fact I\
had it on my mod list I took the oportunity to start this project by imitating some of the way the mod functioned and sometimes took some files from it, those files where coded\
by a modder named  Tartiflette, it's honestly an increadible mod which you should check out when you have the time.
