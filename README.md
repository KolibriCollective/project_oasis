# Project Oasis

Have you ever played starsector with mod like nexerlin or Aotd and taken or colonised worlds in the tens of digit and then realised 
that apart from your first world and maybe two more you simply couldn't name the rest ? that you felt like there was absolutly no
difference between the local terran world with mild climate and the barren planet with no atmosphere ? after all they both reach size 6 
and now won't grow anymore so the hazard condition really doesn't change much, sure both planet will have access to different item 
but does it really make those to planet completly different ?

what if condition like no atmosphere or extreme weather changed much more than the hazard condition \
making the colonisation of planet with those effect harder or easier, making you able to build around \
there specific advantage and maybe even invest into massive project that will make planets truly unique ? 

this is what Project Oasis is trying to achieve.


## when is the mod going to be released ? 

Probably in the next 6 mounth maybe later if progress is slower than I anticipated.
on the other hand the first part of the mod should come out by late **december**.
this would include the rework of all of the current planetary condition.
